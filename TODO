* glossary improvements
    - world-editable
    - localizable

* compendium packs 
    - i've got the common powers in there, but nothing else
    - core classes and roles? could prewrite macros. lots of effort. maybe licensing issues.
    - monster traits for gm
    - entire sample monsters?

* popout power cards
    - https://gitlab.com/foundrynet/dnd5e/-/blob/master/module/item/entity.js#L297

* macro apis
    - advantage/disadvantage from target picker
    - gather/apply effects
    - encounter power used state
        - statuses, maybe duration?

* structured character creation?
    - make it easier for players to reuse elements
    - initial setup, use compendiua
    - feat/role boost levels
    - advances

* update on submit mode setting (latency issue)

* use qfa icons for powers

* combat update on alternate resources 
    unfortunately this is in Token - _onUpdateBaseActor and _onUpdateTokenActor, which hardcode handling a single resource
    can call canvas.addPendingOperation(`CombatTracker.render`, ui.combat.render, ui.combat); from anywhere though
