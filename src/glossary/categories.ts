If you take any action that would reveal your position such as leaving cover, using an Opportunity, or making an attack, you are still considered <i>Hidden</i> until the action is fully resolved. So you can Charge out of cover at an enemy and still have Advantage on that attack, but if you move and then attack, your attack does not have Advantage. If you use a power that allows you to make multiple attacks, you only have Advantage on the first.",

You can’t hide behind a tree and expect the enemy to just forget where you are. Once you are <i>Hidden</i> you need not remain out of sight so long as you keep to cover or concealment. If you want to dart from one piece of cover to another without being seen, you must make a Skill Roll as you move, and the GM is within their rights to disallow such an action if your movement is directly where the enemy would be looking — right across a hallway, say."
